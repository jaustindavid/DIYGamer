# DIYGamer
games &amp; stuff targeted for the DIYGamer project from twsu.co (which is AWESOME btw)

the GoL implementation is by-the-book (see wikipedia for rules).  On the DIYGamer platform
we've added a flashing cursor starting at (3,3) which can intervene, creating a live cell 
to influence the rest of the board.
